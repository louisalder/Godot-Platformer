The game was created in compatibility mode.
OS compatibility: MacOS, Windows, Linux

### ✅ Completed Features:

### 🛠️ Planned Features:
- Cool animations using shaders

### 🪲Bugs:
- Player gets stuck in the tree currently
- Need to fix when a character is jumping and moving left or right simultaneously, this currently doesn't work properly.
