# My first Godot Platformer

This is my first-ever 2D platformer game created in Godot! It is a work-in progress. I am creating this project as a challenge to myself to learn Godot.

# Compatibility
Godot Version: 4.3
The game was created in compatibility mode.
OS compatibility: MacOS, Windows, Linux

### ‚úÖ Completed Features:
- Player movement (run, jump, idle animations)
- Basic level design elements integrated
- Basic physics  

### üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features:
- Cool animations using shaders
- Pause UI and start menu  
- Completed levels, with increasing difficulty
- Moving background elements
- Enemies with combat

### ü™≤Bugs:
- Parallax background doesn't function as expected. It should move with the player but it doesn't yet.
